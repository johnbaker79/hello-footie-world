Footie Analysis &amp; Data
Hello everyone, my name is John Baker.  
I am currently on a mission to learn all I can about data science, data analytics, their parts, how it is done and how I can apply it to soccer worldwide.  
I am passionate about the game of soccer but just learning about the field of data science and how to apply it.  I'm excited to get started, learn, apply and succeed.  
I have completed the initial assignment of a pull request and merge.  (Update #1)
I am testing this to see if I remember and understand the process. (Update #1)
